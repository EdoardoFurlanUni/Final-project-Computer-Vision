# Final-project-Computer-Vision
To use Cmake
- Download repository
- On the terminal:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

Folder "build" never gets uploaded and has to remain in the .gitignore
CMakeLists.txt needs to be updated in case new files or new executables are to be created (in the add_executable function)

Each time you want to compile just time "make" in the terminal window
